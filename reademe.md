The Matter.js library has a function called
Matter.SAT.collides().
This function takes 2 parameters and returns true if there
was collision between the 2 bodies and false if there is no
collision between them.

We’ll declare the collision variable and store the values
we get from the Matter.SAT.collides() function in it.
Now the collision variable will have either true or false as
a value.
